Type,Beast,Vulnerability 1,Description
Beasts,Bear,Beast Oil. Quen Sign,"Bears are omnivores - meaning men find a place in their diet beside berries, roots and salmon. When they snack on humans, they most frequently partake of the meat of travelers unwittingly trespassing on their territory or else that of hunters for whom besting such a creature is a lifelong ambition.\nThere are several subspecies of bears - black bears, polar bears and cave bears - which differ from one another in coloring as well as in size and strength. All share one trait in common, however: a near-unmatched ability to kill. \nBears are found far from human habitation, in high mountains or deep woods. They are solitary creatures - and a good thing they are, for defeating a single bear is a challenge to anyone, experienced witchers included. Fighting a bear should be avoided, but if it cannot, one should not try to run away - these seemingly clumsy animal can run at an astonishingly high speed, especially if angered."
